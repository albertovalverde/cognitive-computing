DAVOS: Help me get him inside.

The other Night’s Watch brothers pick up JON SNOW’s body and carry it away. DAVOS remains, staring at the left over pool of blood.

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - ROOM

DOLOROUS EDD wipes the table clean. The other Night’s Watch brothers place JON SNOW’s body on the table. DOLOROUS EDD places his hand on JON SNOW’s wounds, then brushes JON SNOW’s eyes closed.

DOLOROUS EDD: Thorne did this.

DAVOS: How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?

DOLOROUS EDD: Trust? The men in this room.

DAVOS: Does the wolf know you?

DOLOROUS EDD looks at DAVOS over his shoulder and nods.

DAVOS: We need all the help we can get.

As DOLOROUS EDD moves towards the door, someone knocks on it. The Night’s Watch brothers draw their blades.

MELISANDRE (O.S.): Ser Davos.

DOLOROUS EDD looks over his shoulder at DAVOS. DAVOS nods. The Night’s Watch brothers sheathe their swords. DOLOROUS EDD walks to the door and opens it. MELISANDRE enters. DOLOROUS EDD closes the door behind her. MELISANDRE is distressed at the sight of JON SNOW’s body.

MELISANDRE: I saw him in the flames, fighting at Winterfell.

DAVOS: I can’t speak for the flames, but he’s gone.

MELISANDRE touches JON SNOW’s cheek.

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - MESS HALL

ALLISER THORNE sits at the high table among the other leaders of the Night’s Watch. The rest of the Night’s Watch brothers are shouting at each other.

MALE VOICE #1: He was our Lord Commander!

MALE VOICE #2: He never should have been!

ALLISER THORNE pounds his fist three times on the high table, then stands. The room quiets.

ALLISER THORNE: You all know why you’re here. Jon Snow is dead.

NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #1: Who killed him?

ALLISER THORNE: I did.

The Night’s Watch brothers resume shouting.

ALLISER THORNE: And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck and the other officers in this castle.

NIGHT’S WATCHMEN #1: Murderers!

NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #2: Traitors!

The shouting resumes. OLLIE walks up beside the high table. ALLISER THORNE pounds the high table again.

ALLISER THORNE: You’re right!

The shouting stops.

ALLISER THORNE: We’ve committed treason, all of us. Jon Snow was my Lord Commander. I had no love for him. That was no secret. But I never once disobeyed an order. Loyalty is the foundation on which the Night’s Watch is built, and the Watch means everything to me. I have given my life, we have all given our lives to the Night’s Watch. Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night’s Watch. He let the wildlings through our gates, as no Lord Commander has ever done before. He gave them the very land on which they reaved and raped and murdered. Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right, I’ve no doubt about that. And what he thought was right would have been the end of us. He thrust a terrible choice upon us, and we made it.

The men begin to murmur among themselves.

CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - ROOM

GHOST nudges JON SNOW’s hand and whimpers.

DAVOS: He’ll have seen we didn’t come. Thorne will have made it official by now. Castle Black is his.

DOLOROUS EDD: I don’t care who’s sitting at the high table. Jon was my friend, and those fuckers butchered him. Now we return the favor.

DAVOS: We don’t have the numbers.

DOLOROUS EDD: We have a direwolf.

DAVOS: It’s not enough. I didn’t know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn’t have wanted his friends to die for nothing.

DOLOROUS EDD: If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room. We all die today. I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.

DAVOS: We need to fight, but we don’t need to die. Not if we have help.

NIGHT’S WATCHMAN: Who’s gonna help us?

DAVOS: You’re not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.

DOLOROUS EDD’s washes over with realization. He turns to the Night’s Watchman at his side.

DOLOROUS EDD: Bolt the door. Don’t let anyone in. I’ll be back as soon as I can.

DOLOROUS EDD leaves through the door.

EXT. WINTERFELL - DAY
Two men sit on horses on a hill outside Winterfell. They carry flags bearing the flayed man sigil of House Bolton.

RAMSAY (V.O.): She was 11 the first time I saw her.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - ROOM

MYRANDA’s body lies on a table.

RAMSAY: The kennelmaster’s daughter. She smelled of dog. I wasn’t much older, but everybody was already afraid of me. You certainly were.

RAMSAY turns and looks at MAESTER WOLKAN, then looks back at MYRANDA’s body..

RAMSAY: Myranda wasn’t, though. What could I do to her that those hounds couldn’t? She was fearless. There was nothing she wouldn’t do.

RAMSAY stands and places his hand on MYRANDA’s forehead.

RAMSAY: Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over. I wish you could be here to watch.

RAMSAY looks as though he is going to cry.

MAESTER WOLKAN: Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord? Or would you rather the men build a pyre?

RAMSAY: Buried, burned?

RAMSAY walks past MAESTER WOLKAN as he exits the room.

RAMSAY: This is good meat. Feed it to the hounds.

CUT TO: WINTERFELL - HALLWAY

RAMSAY is walking with ROOSE.

ROOSE: Your command of the cavalry was impressive. Thanks to you, the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead. Do you know who struck the killing blow?

RAMSAY: No.

ROOSE: A shame. I’d reward the man. Still, a great victory. Do you feel like a victor?

RAMSAY and ROOSE stop walking. RAMSAY looks back over his shoulder at ROOSE.

ROOSE: I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark. Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?

RAMSAY: No.

ROOSE walks past RAMSAY into Winterfell’s great hall.

ROOSE: A reckoning will come. We need the North to face it. The entire North. They won’t back us without Sansa Stark. We no longer have Sansa Stark. You played your games with her. You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they’re both gone.

RAMSAY: I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds. They won’t get far.

ROOSE: I’m glad to hear it. Without Sansa, you won’t be able to produce an heir. And without an heir, well…

ROOSE sits at the dinner table. RAMSAY stares at him, astonished.

ROOSE: ...let’s hope the maesters are right and Lady Walder’s carrying a boy.

EXT. NORTHERN WILDERNESS
SANSA and THEON are running through the woods frantically. The barking of dogs can be heard in the distance. SANSA tires. THEON runs back to hear and pulls her onward.

THEON: We can’t stop.

The pair resume running. They happen upon a large, snowy river.

THEON: We have to cross here.

SANSA steps on a patch of thin ice and gasps.

SANSA: I can’t.

THEON: It’s the only way to throw off the hounds.

SANSA: But it’s too cold. I can’t. I won’t make it. I’ll die.

THEON: I’ve seen what his hounds do to a person. This way is better.

THEON guides SANSA into the water. SANSA gasps at the cold. The both wade across.

CUT TO: NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS

THEON and SANSA are walking together. They are blue with cold. Barking can no longer be heard. THEON spots something off camera.

THEON: Over here. Come on.

THEON leads SANSA to an overturned tree. Its roots provide shelter from the snow. They sit down under the roots, shivering.

THEON: Sansa. Sansa.

THEON wraps his arms around SANSA. She rests her head on his shoulder and closes her eyes. Dogs barking can suddenly be heard closeby.

THEON: Stay here. I’ll lure them away.

SANSA: No, I won’t make it without you.

THEON: You will. Go north, only north. Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black. He’ll help you.

THEON runs into the woods but is immediately confronted by House Bolton soldiers and hounds.

BOLTON OFFICER: Where is Lady Bolton?

THEON: Dead.

BOLTON OFFICER: Liar.

THEON: She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts. I left her to die in the snow.

The dogs catch SANSA’s scent and begin barking. They lead the soldiers to SANSA under the roots of the tree. SANSA cowers from them.

BOLTON OFFICER: I can’t wait to see what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time.

One of the soldiers grabs SANSA and pulls her to her feet. A horse whinnies in the distance. The soldiers draw their weapons. BRIENNE and PODRICK ride towards the soldiers with their sword drawn.

BOLTON OFFICER: It’s a bloody woman.
