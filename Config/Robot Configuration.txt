# This document contains parameters for the robot that can be configured to personalise or 
# tailor the robot to specific demonstrations.

# DO NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE PARAMETER NAMES (WORDS PRECEDED BY AN UNDERSCORE), JUST THE VALUES
# PROCEEDING THE COLON (:).


# -- Natural Language Classifier -- #
# First NLC classifier to compare against (this determines flow of conversation). Must be a
# valid classifier name, not ID.
_firstNlc: BasicConversationWithTherapy
# Set minimum confidence threshold for an NLC classification to be accepted (number between
# 0 and 1, 1 = 100% confidence).
_nlcConfThreshold: 0.75
# Maximum number of NLC classifications that are returned, in descending order of confidence.
# MAXIMUM NUMBER IS 10.
_nlcNumToReturn: 3
# Set the region that your instance of NLC exists in. Options are Australia or US South.
_regionNlc: EE.UU.sur


# -- Visual Recognition -- #
# Set the region that your instance of VR exists in. Options are Australia or US South.
_regionVr: EE.UU.sur
# Set name of the custom visual recognition classifier that you want to use.
_vrClassifierName: Visual Recognition-5s
# Set minimum confidence threshold for a VR classification to be returned as an option (number between
# 0 and 1, 1 = 100% confidence).
_vrConfThreshold: 0.5
# Set the name of the image file to be used for VR.
_pictureFileName: NaomiPictureCapture.png
# Maximum number of VR classifications that are returned, in descending order of confidence.
_vrNumToReturn: 5


# -- Robot eyes -- #
# Set colour of robot's eyes for different stages of interaction. Colours that you can choose 
# from are yellow, blue, green, magenta, cyan, and white ONLY.
# Eye colours when listening, speaking, performing a robot action, and when considering its 
# response (receiving NLC analysis)
_listeningColour: blue
_speakingColour: green
_actionPerformColour: cyan
_responseColour: yellow
_lookingColour: magenta
# Timing for fade between changing eye colours
_ledTiming: 0.2


# -- Robot speech -- #
# Set speech speed and other parameters.
# Speech speed (number between 0 and 200, 100 is default speed)
_speechSpeed: 87


# -- Robot manager -- #
# Set parameters like sitting/standing speed.
# SPEEDS HIGHER THAN 0.9 ARE NOT RECOMMENDED. Use personal discretion.
# Set whether or not fall manager is on or off. 1 = on, 0 = off (recommended: 1).
_fallManager: 1
# Time for the robot to stand up, sit down, lie down, and crouch (number between 0 and 1, 1 is
# fastest, 0 is slowest)
_standSpeed: 0.8
_sitSpeed: 0.65
_lieSpeed: 0.65
_crouchSpeed: 0.9


# -- Robot audio -- #
# Set parameters for the robot's comprehension/listen sound effects, and other audio. Default
# setting is two sine waves that are played after each other at different frequencies.
# Time between sine waves for comprehension/listen sound effects (seconds).
_sineDelay: 0.06
# Sine wave frequencies (Hz)
_sineFreq1: 659.255
_sineFreq2: 830.609
# Location of audio files that Naomi can play when requested
